# Instructions for Running the Program

## Preparations

- Make sure point data set files (pts) that you want to test are in the same directory 
as the rest of the project file.

## Running the Program

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory containing your program 
and input files.
   
2. **Execute the Program**: Type 'python3 main_test_demo.py [path to point data set] 
[capacity value]'

3. **Answer the Prompt to Specify Dataset Type**: Type 'bathymetric' or 'chm' to choose 
what is computed and outputed
    - As the project description specifies, roughness, curvature, and maxima are to be 
    computed and outputed for a bathymetric dataset while only the maxima is processed 
    for a chm dataset

Ensure your input files are correctly formatted and located in the same directory as 
the program for seamless execution.
